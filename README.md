# Akan Name Generator

## Project Overview
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that generates an Akan name based on a user’s date of birth and gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian culture and are traditionally given according to the day of the week a person is born.

This project was developed as a learning exercise to practice using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **GitHub** for version control.

## Features
- User input for day, month, and year of birth  
- Gender selection (male or female)  
- Calculation of the day of the week  
- Display of the corresponding Akan name  
- Basic input validation  
- Simple and clean user interface  


## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – page structure  
- **CSS** – styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – logic and validation  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and project hosting  

## How the Application Works
1. The user enters their birth date (day, month, year).  
2. The user selects their gender.  
3. On form submission:  
   - JavaScript validates the inputs.  
   - The day of the week is calculated.  
   - An Akan name is selected from predefined arrays.  
   - The result is displayed on the web page.  


## Using GitHub
This project is stored and managed using GitHub. GitHub was used to:  
- Track changes to the project files  
- Store the project in a remote repository  
- Manage commits during development  

### Basic Git Workflow
1. Initialize a Git repository  
2. Add project files  
3. Commit changes with meaningful messages  
4. Push the project to GitHub  

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.  
2. Ensure all project files are in the same folder.  
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
4. Enter your birth details and select a gender.  
5. Click submit to view your Akan name.
