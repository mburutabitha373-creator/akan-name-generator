# Akan Name Generator

## Project Overview
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that generates an Akan name
based on a user’s date of birth and gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian
culture and are traditionally given according to the day of the week a person
is born.

This project was developed as part of a learning exercise to practice using
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub for version control.


## Features
- User input for day, month, and year of birth
- Gender selection (male or female)
- Calculation of the day of the week
- Display of the corresponding Akan name
- Basic input validation
- Simple and clean user interface


## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – page structure
- **CSS** – styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – logic and validation
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and project hosting


## How the Application Works
1. The user enters their birth date in the format MM, DD, YYYY.
2. The user selects their gender.
3. On form submission:
   - JavaScript validates the inputs.
   - The day of the week is calculated using the JavaScript `Date` object.
   - An Akan name is selected from predefined arrays.
4. The result is displayed on the web page.
## Using GitHub
This project is stored and managed using GitHub.

GitHub was used to:
- Track changes to the project files
- Store the project in a remote repository
- Manage commits during development

### Basic Git Workflow Used
1. Initialize a Git repository
2. Add project files
3. Commit changes with meaningful messages
4. Push the project to GitHub

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure all project files are in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Enter your birth details and select a gender.
5. Click submit to view your Akan name.
